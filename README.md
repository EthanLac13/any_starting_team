# any_starting_team
An online home for the releases of the Any Starting Team PMDO mod.

This is a mod for the fangame Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Origins, by Audino.

Start with a team of up to 4 Pokémon of your choosing! Choose the form, gender and shininess of each of your team members before starting the game. This mod is perfect for both roleplayers who want to explore Guildmaster Island with an existing team, and challenge runners who'd like to see if they can beat the game with a team of Delibird, Unown, and Luvdisc.

My thanks go out to:
* Palika, for providing much of the code which makes this mod function
* Logical123, Sloth, and meow meow beep boop, for playtesting and feedback
